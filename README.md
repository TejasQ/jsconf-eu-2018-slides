# [Tejas' JSConf EU 2018 Conference Slides](https://tejas-jsconf-eu.now.sh)

[Link to _actual slides_ in case you missed it](https://tejas-jsconf-eu.now.sh)

This project was fun to put together. I created it with Create React App. It uses [react-praise](https://github.com/tejasq/react-praise) to allow me to navigate my [conference slides for JSConf EU 2018](https://2018.jsconf.eu/speakers/tejas-kumar-from-you-can-t-to-you-can-the-welcoming-nature-of-javascript.html) using my voice and Chrome's [SpeechRecognition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition).

Feel free to explore!
